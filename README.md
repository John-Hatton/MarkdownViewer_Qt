# Markdown Viewer (Qt)

---

### Introduction

I have been writing a lot of markdown documents, and was really happy with Obsidian, but thought I
would try to do write a Qt6 Program, which features a Markdown Renderer.

### Building

Ensure that you have qt6 installed on your system.

Be sure to update the value in the CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH in ./CMakeLists.txt, to match where your Qt 
install is located.
